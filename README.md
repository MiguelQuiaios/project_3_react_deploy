## Description

This is an app that allows the user to find people with the same interests as him and form a group and discuss strategies to achieve their goals faster. The app also provides information about the interest of the group.

## User Stories

-  **404:** As a user I get to see a 404 page with a feedback message if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault.
-  **Signup:** As an anonymous user I can sign up on the platform so that I can start creating and joining groups.
-  **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can access my profile and start creating and joining groups.
-  **Logout:** As a logged in user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it.
-  **Profile Page**: As a logged in user I can visit my profile page and edit my interests in case IÂ´m not as passion about it as i once was or if I find a new interest.
-  **Add Groups:** As a logged in user I can access the  groups page so that I can create a new group.
-  **Edit Groups:** As a logged in user I can access the edit group page so that I can change something that my team thinks is not okay like the description.
-  **Add members:** As a user I can accept people that are interest in joining the group.
-  **View Groups:** As a user I want to see the groups and the members in it and chat with them.
